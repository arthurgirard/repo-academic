summary: tf_gnns released!
abstract: "I am thrilled to announce open-sourcing my own pandemic baby: a 0tensorflow-based Graph Network library! It started in part as a learning exercise, and in part as a reaction to some design choices I didn't find comfortable in the deep-mind's graph_nets library (like the use of sonnet for easy network creation)."
