summary: "Delivered a presentation on my Graph Net and Bayesian Deep Learning work on crack detection and farm-level turbine interactions. "
abstract: "I presented my approach to UQ and ML when dealing with large-volumes of high-dimensional data that contain some structure. I briefly presented the supervised learning work on [crack localization with arbitrarily positioned strain-sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06791) and parts of the work on building supervised/semi-supervised graph-structured latent variable models with the [relational VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16049). Moreover, I presented some results that appear in my PhD work using trained RVAEs for selecting optimal sub-sets of turbines for monitoring."
