        <li>Click on a node to show publication details. It will open up a

        <li>On the publication details panel, you can click on the <em>target</em>

        a related publication will move to that publication (in the graph and in the

        <li>Above a certain zoom level, publication titles are automatically

      <dt>Where does this come from?</dt>

      <dd>The author names of the participants of the 1st DSML@DBAUG workshop 
      were extracted, and google scholar was scraped to  retrieve the most relevant 
      results when their names were searched. 

      Some of the participants did not have a google scholar account and 
      there was a limit on the maximum number of possible requests on google-scholar.
      Nevertheless, 670+ publications were scraped. Also, no care was taken to filter out wrong hits on  
      the author names (too much work). 

      When you hover over a node the author name and the neighbors are highlighted. 


      <dt>And how was this concrete "author network" made?</dt>
      <dd>This is how I did it:
        <ol style="margin: 0px;">
          <li> Google scholar web scraping (using a Selenium-based library called scholarly) was performed for the author names</li>
            <li> The first 20 results were kept (the results contain extended citation info - such as title, abstract, other authors, publication venue & year etc) </li>
            <li> The title and abstract were contatenated and a phrase embedding using a pre-trained transformer neural network were computed.</li>
            <li> A similarity between all the embeddings of the publications was then computed. This similarity is the edge weight between two nodes. </li>
        </ol>
      </dd>

      The visualization of the graph was adapted from <a href http://bl.ocks.org/paulovn/9686202/>this example</a>
